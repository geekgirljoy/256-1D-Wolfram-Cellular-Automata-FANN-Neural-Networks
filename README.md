256 1D Wolfram Cellular Automata Rules FANN Neural Networks PRE-TRAINED &amp; TRAINING FILES

### Here's what you get with this repo:
 256 training sets (.data files) to review, modify  and train neural networks to perform all 256 (0 – 255) rules  conveniently organized into separate files and named after the rule that  it trains the network on.
 
 256 PRE-TRAINED neural networks (.net files) capable of performing the computation as outlined in my [Elementary Cellular Automata](https://geekgirljoy.wordpress.com/2017/10/02/ancestor-simulations-elementary-cellular-automata/) series except via neural networks.
 
 #### 5 separate programs (.php files):  
 1. **generate_rule_set.php**: This program will recreate the entire set of 256 .data training files.
 2. **train_all.php**:  This program will train all 256 FANN .net neural networks.
 3. **train_specific.php**: This program lets you enter the  rule numbers into an array prior to running to train the specific rules  as FANN .net file neural networks.
 4. **ann_output_all_rule_set_images.php**: This program will render all the rules as images using the neural networks.
 5. **ann_output_specific_rule_images.php**: This program will render the specified rules as images using the specified neural networks.

 **AND** The entire set of rules (0 – 255) per-rendered as 1025x1025px PNG images.
 
*You will need PHP and FANN installed for this to work. I have a public tutorial on how to setup your test environment for free here:*
